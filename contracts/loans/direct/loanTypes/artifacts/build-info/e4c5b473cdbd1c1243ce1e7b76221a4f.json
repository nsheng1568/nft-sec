The\n borrower will always have to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay\n early.\n @param _lenderNonce - The nonce referred to here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce. We are\n referring instead to nonces that are used by both the lender and the borrower when they are first signing\n off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonces can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an\n off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the\n lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:\n - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.\n - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun()\n, which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains\n that nonce.\n @return Borrower and Lender addresses"
