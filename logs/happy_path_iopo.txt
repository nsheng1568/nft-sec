Step 1: Initiating NFTfi loans...
wETH balances before NFTfi loans:
	Structurer: 10
	Borrower 1: 0
	Borrower 2: 0
NFTfi Promissory Note 1 issued to Structurer
NFTfi Promissory Note 2 issued to Structurer
Bored Ape 0 transferred to NFTfi
Bored Ape 1 transferred to NFTfi
wETH balances after NFTfi loans:
	Structurer: 8.5
	Borrower 1: 1
	Borrower 2: 0.5

Step 2: Minting tranche tokens...
NFTfi Promissory Note 1 transferred to NftSec
NFTfi Promissory Note 2 transferred to NftSec
Tranche tokens minted:
	IO Tranche:
		Quantity - 0.6 x 10^18
		Price    - 1.03 wei
	PO Tranche:
		Quantity - 0.8 x 10^18
		Price    - 1.03 wei
	Residual Tranche:
		Price    - 0.1 ETH

Step 3: Investing in tranche tokens...
wETH balances before tranche purchases:
	Structurer: 8.5
	Investor 1: 10
	Investor 2: 10
	Investor 3: 10
	Investor 4: 10
Investor 1 purchased 0.6 x 10^18 IO tranche tokens
Investor 2 purchased 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens
Investor 3 purchased 1 residual tranche token
Investor 4 is dissatisfied with the initial price of PO tranche, so she waits ---
	PO tranche price is now 0.9711 wei
	PO tranche price is now 0.9122 wei
	PO tranche price is now 0.8534 wei
Investor 4 purchased 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens
wETH balances after tranche purchases:
	Structurer: 9.94186
	Investor 1: 9.3997
	Investor 2: 9.5998
	Investor 3: 9.9
	Investor 4: 9.65864

Step 4: Repaying loan...
wETH balances before repaying loan:
	NftSec contract: 0
	Borrower 1     : 11
Borrower 1 repaid her loan backed by Bored Ape 0
wETH balances after repaying loan:
	NftSec contract: 1.095
	Borrower 1     : 9.9

Step 5: Liquidating collateral...
wETH balances before liquidating collateral:
	NftSec contract: 1.095
	Liquidator     : 10
Liquidator is interested in Bored Ape 1, so she periodically checks the price ---
	Bored Ape 1 is not available for liquidation yet
	Bored Ape 1 is available for a price of 0.9565217391304348 ETH
	Bored Ape 1 is available for a price of 0.782608695652174 ETH
	Bored Ape 1 is available for a price of 0.6086956521739131 ETH
Bored Ape 1 transferred to Liquidator
wETH balances after repaying loan:
	NftSec contract: 1.703695652173913
	Liquidator     : 9.391304347826088

Step 6: Transacting fungible tokens...
Tranche token ownership before secondary market transactions:
	Investor 1 owns 0.6 x 10^18 IO tranche tokens
	Investor 2 owns 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens
	Investor 3 owns 1 residual tranche token
	Investor 4 owns 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens
Tranche token ownership after secondary market transactions:
	Investor 1 owns 0.3 x 10^18 IO tranche tokens
	Investor 3 owns 1 residual tranche token
	Investor 4 owns 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens
	Investor 5 owns 0.3 x 10^18 IO tranche and 0.4 x 10^18 PO tranche tokens

Step 7: Redeeming tokens...
wETH balances before redeeming tokens:
	NftSec contract: 1.703695652173913
	Investor 1     : 9.3997
	Investor 3     : 9.9
	Investor 4     : 9.65864
	Investor 5     : 0
Investor 3, who holds the residual token, waits for the product to mature ---
Investor 3 redeems her residual token, capturing the computation bounty
Investors 1, 4, and 5 also redeem their tokens afterwards
wETH balances after redeeming tokens:
	NftSec contract: 1e-18
	Investor 1     : 9.501547826086957
	Investor 3     : 10
	Investor 4     : 10.35864
	Investor 5     : 0.8018478260869566

End of test.
